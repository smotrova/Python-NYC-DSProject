# Python-NYC-DSProject

The people of New Yorker use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Various agencies in New York are assigned these problems. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes [311 complaints](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) that are related to housing and buildings.

The agency needs answers to several questions. The answers to those questions must be supported by data and analytics. These are their  questions:

* Which type of complaint should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on first?

* Should the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City focus on any particular set of boroughs, ZIP codes, or street (where the complaints are severe) for the specific type of complaints you identified in response to Question 1?

* Can a predictive model be built for a future prediction of the possibility of complaints of the type that you have identified in response to question 1?


To address these main business problems identified in this project use following data science techniques:

* Ingest the course datasets.

* Explore the datasets and identify the key problem.

* Identify and create features to create machine learning models.

* Build possible machine learning model(s).
